# Real-Time Visual Obstacle Detection on Duckiebot DB21-J4 with NVIDIA Jetson Nano 4GB


## About
This project builds on the open-source Duckietown platform by deploying an autonomous robot with integrated object detection capabilities. It investigates how perception and control systems interact in real time, allowing the robot to identify and react to physical objects (represented by yellow rubber ducks) on the Duckietown road. The project emphasizes practical applications of computer vision and autonomous decision-making in a simplified yet dynamic setting.

## Instructions
The Duckiebot autonomously drives through a custom-built Duckietown layout, leveraging object detection to identify rubber ducks randomly positioned along the roadway. To support this functionality, we collect training data from the Duckietown simulator and use it to train a YOLOv5 object detection model. Once trained, the model will be integrated into the Duckietown autonomy stack to enhance the robotâ€™s perception capabilities in real time.<br>

## Setting up the Duckietown environment:

Fork the [duckietown-lx learning environment repository](https://github.com/duckietown/duckietown-lx) and follow all the steps outlined in the Duckietown-LX instructions. Create a new repository and push your work to your own repository [duckietown instructions](https://github.com/duckietown/duckietown-lx/blob/mooc2022/README.md)

Make sure system is up-to-date
