# Real-Time Visual Obstacle Detection on Duckiebot


## About
This project builds on the open-source Duckietown platform by deploying an autonomous robot with integrated object detection capabilities. It investigates how perception and control systems interact in real time, allowing the robot to identify and react to physical objects (represented by yellow rubber ducks) on the Duckietown road. The project emphasizes practical applications of computer vision and autonomous decision-making in a simplified yet dynamic setting.

## Instructions
The Duckiebot autonomously drives through a custom-built Duckietown layout, using object detection to identify rubber ducks placed at random on the roadway.
